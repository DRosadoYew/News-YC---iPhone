## About

**News/YC** is an iOS app that tries to do one thing, give you [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and get the hell out of the way. If the app isn't doing something you feel it should, or if you think there's an easier way to get an action accomplished - open up an Issue! I want your feedback. This app was made by me, for my usage, so it probably won't line up with everybody's tastes and there is probably a huge group of people with better taste than me. Feel free to be vocal - it's the only way to make this app the best!
